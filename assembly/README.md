We encountered some bugs with calling convention as well as freeing memory.

Hardest: Managing registers on Classify. It was really difficult to fit everything we wanted to store into the 12 s registers. We had to get creative storing on the stack.
Easiest: ReLu
Most Fun: Finishing Classify
Least Fun: Wrapping our brains around what we had to do for matmul. The stride length of the matrices was a hard concept to understand.
